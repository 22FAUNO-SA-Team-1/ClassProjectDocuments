## Team Motivation

While I wouldn't go as far as to say we found it difficult to select a project, it did take us a few iterations and discussion sessions to narrow down a subject that checked all the required boxes.  We wanted a project that would be interesting enough to keep everyone thorougly engaged.  We wanted it to be in languages that were relatively well known and in wide use.  We also wanted to be sure the project would have an active community with a variety of contributors as a healthier project would lend itself well to our needs.  After our initial shortlisted project ideas were set aside due to only impacting individuals, we went in search of another idea.  An admittedly shallow search into trending topics in languages we were familiar with led to Keycloak.  After some more group dicussion as well as approval from Dr. Gandhi, we found Keycloak to be a perfect fit.  It serves as software that can affect small webapps scaling up to massive applications looking for authentication.
