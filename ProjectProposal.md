## Team Motivation

While I wouldn't go as far as to say we found it difficult to select a project, it did take us a few iterations and discussion sessions to narrow down a subject that checked all the required boxes.  We wanted a project that would be interesting enough to keep everyone thoroughly engaged.  We wanted it to be in languages that were relatively well known and in wide use.  We also wanted to be sure the project would have an active community with a variety of contributors as a healthier project would lend itself well to our needs.  

After our initial shortlisted project ideas were set aside due to only impacting individuals, we went in search of another idea.  An admittedly shallow search into trending topics in languages we were familiar with led to Keycloak.  After some more group discussion as well as approval from Dr. Gandhi, we found Keycloak to be a perfect fit.  It serves as software that can affect small webapps scaling up to massive applications looking for authentication.

## Open-Source Project Description

### What is it?
Keycloak is an open source identity and access management tool used for authentication and authorization. Among other things, Keycloak allows its users to implement single-sign on, identify brokering / social logins (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc...). Additionally, Keycloak has a suite of admin tools like their admin console and account management console used for fine tuning allowing organizations to customize Keycloak to their specific needs. 

### Contributors & Activity

As of this writing, Keycloak has 631 individual contributors and 14,800 lifetime commits. The GitHub repository has been stared 13,500 times and it has been forked 4,700 times indicating the the repository itself is quite popular. Keycloak is also very active. New newest commit is only 20 hours old and there have been 23 commits over the past week alone. 

### Languages & Platform

The majority of Keycloke was written in Java, with trace amounts of other languages filling the gaps. The precise of breakdown of programming languages is as follows:

* Java 92.2%
* JavaScript 3.0%
* HTML 2.9%
* FreeMarker 0.6%
* TypeScript 0.5%
* Python 0.2%
* Other 0.6%

Keycloak has two main components:

* Keycloak Server, which is responsible for the API and GUI.
* Keycloak application adapter, which makes up all of the libraries used to call the server.

Based on such a design, the primary platform for Keycloak is web-based. An organization would use the Keycloak API directly inside of their code, but monitoring Keycloak is done from the GUI-based admin console on the Keycloak server.
